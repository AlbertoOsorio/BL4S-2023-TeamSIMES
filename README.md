###Synthetic data generation with Monte Carlo simulation for the training of CNNs.

This Repo contains all the uncompiled code for the GEANT4 simulation that was used in our project and the custom scripts that were generated to extract the Monte Carlo simulation data.

The project uses Geant4 v10.5.0. To use the graphical interface Geant4 must be installed acordingly. It is not necesary to use the graphical interface when running the simulation with our custom scripts.

To replicate our data extraction system. you must execute "./generate.sh" this will start the simulation pipeline
